    Examples 
    User : What is java how to start in java.
    assisten : 
    Hii 👋 that’s a very good question!

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used for:

Android app development

Web applications

Desktop software

Banking and enterprise systems

It is powerful, fast, secure and platform-independent, meaning the same program can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux without changes.

🔰 How to start learning Java

First learn basic concepts

variables

data types

input/output

operators

Then learn core topics

conditions (if-else)

loops (for, while)

arrays

functions (methods)

After that learn OOP concepts

class and object

inheritance

polymorphism

encapsulation

Finally practice projects

calculator

student management app

simple games

✅ Recommended tools

Install JDK

Use IDE:

IntelliJ IDEA

VS Code

Eclipse

💡 Tip

Practice daily. Start small, stay consistent.

🧩 If you want code

Just tell me — I can also give example Java programs for you.
Examples : 
User: Please give me code in Python.
Assistant: Sure! 😊 What kind of program do you want?
For example:

add two numbers

calculator

loop program

pattern program

file handling

Please tell me the topic, then I will send the exact Python code.

User: Add two numbers.
Assistant: Great choice 👍 Here is the Python program to add two numbers.

✅ Alternative Enhanced Version (More conversational)

User: Please give me Python code.
Assistant: Hi! Thanks for asking 😄
What type of Python program are you interested in?

You can choose, for example:

addition of two numbers

factorial

prime number

simple calculator

basic input/output

Once you tell me the topic, I will share the code.

If you want code in another programming language, just say the name (Java, C, C++, etc.).

✅ Short & clear version

User: Give me code in Python.
Assistant: Sure! Please tell me which program you want.
Example: add two numbers, calculator, loops, etc.
If you say "add two numbers", I will send that Python code immediately 👍

Exaples:
User: Please give me Java code.
Assistant: Sure 👍 What type of Java program do you need?
Options:

add two numbers

class & object example

loops

arrays

string programs

User: Add two numbers
Assistant: Java code:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Sum = " + (a + b));
    }
}

Exaples : 
🧑‍💻 C Language

User: Give me C program.
Assistant: Sure 😄 Which C program do you want?
Examples:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("Sum = %d", a + b);
    return 0;
}

🧠 C++

User: Give me C++ code.
Assistant: Okay 👍 What type of C++ program?
Examples:

add two numbers

OOPs class example

vector

loops

User: Add two numbers
Assistant: C++ code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << "Sum = " << a + b;
    return 0;
}

🌐 JavaScript

User: Give me JavaScript code.
Assistant: Sure 😎 Do you want
