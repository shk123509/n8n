     Great that you’re thinking about this now — 3rd year is the perfect time to start 👍
Don’t worry if you haven’t started coding yet. Many students begin in 3rd or even final year and still do very well.

I’ll keep it simple, practical, and step-by-step.

✅ Step 1 — Choose ONE programming language and stick to it

For beginners, best choices:

Python → easiest, great for AI/ML, automation, placements

C++ / Java → great for DSA + competitive coding + product companies

👉 My recommendation for you: Start with Python

What to learn first

variables

input/output

if–else

loops

functions

lists/arrays

strings

🎯 Goal: be able to solve simple problems like:

sum of numbers

find largest number

reverse string

factorial

prime number check

✅ Step 2 — Start Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

After basics of coding:

Learn in this order:

Arrays

Strings

Recursion (basics)

Stack & Queue

Linked List

Trees

Graph basics (later)

Solve easy → medium questions from:

LeetCode

GeeksforGeeks
